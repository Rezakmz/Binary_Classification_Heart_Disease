# Binary_Classification_Heart_Disease
This project involves creating a logistic regression algorithm from scratch and then comparing the results with Sklearn's LogisticRegression model. The dataset used in this project is information about the patients, and the target variable is to predict whether a person is prone to heart disease. The attributes of this dataset are as follows:

age: The person's age in years

sex: The person's sex (1 = male, 0 = female)

cp: The chest pain experienced (Value 1: typical angina, Value 2: atypical angina, Value 3: non-anginal pain, Value 4: asymptomatic)

trestbps: The person's resting blood pressure (mm Hg on admission to the hospital)

chol: The person's cholesterol measurement in mg/dl

fbs: The person's fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl, 1 = true; 0 = false)

restecg: Resting electrocardiographic measurement (0 = normal, 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria)

thalach: The person's maximum heart rate achieved

exang: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest ('ST' relates to positions on the ECG plot. See more here)

slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (Value 1: upsloping, Value 2: flat, Value 3: downsloping)

ca: The number of major vessels (0-3)

thal: A blood disorder called thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect)

target: Heart disease (0 = no, 1 = yes)
